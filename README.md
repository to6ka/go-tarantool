# Client in Go for Tarantool

The `go-tarantool` package has everything necessary for interfacing with
[Tarantool 1.6+](http://tarantool.org/).

The advantage of integrating Go with Tarantool, which is an application server
plus a DBMS, is that Go programmers can handle databases and perform on-the-fly
recompilations of embedded Lua routines, just as in C, with responses that are
faster than other packages according to public benchmarks.

## Installation

We assume that you have Tarantool version 1.6 and a modern Linux or BSD
operating system.

You will need a current version of `go`, version 1.3 or later (use
`go version` to check the version number). Do not use `gccgo-go`.

**Note:** If your `go` version is younger than 1.3, or if `go` is not installed,
download the latest tarball from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/) and say:

```bash
$ sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.7.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
$ export GOPATH="/usr/local/go/go-tarantool"
$ sudo chmod -R a+rwx /usr/local/go </pre>
```

The `go-tarantool` package is in
[tarantool/go-tarantool](github.com/tarantool/go-tarantool) repository.
To download and install, say:

```
$ go get github.com/tarantool/go-tarantool
```

This should bring source and binary files into subdirectories of `/usr/local/go`,
making it possible to access by adding `github.com/tarantool/go-tarantool` in
the `import {...}` section at the start of any Go program.

<h2>Hello World</h2>

In the "[Connectors](https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/getting_started/getting_started_go/)"
chapter of the Tarantool manual, there is an explanation of a very short (18-line)
program written in Go. Follow the instructions at the start of the "Connectors"
chapter carefully. Then cut and paste the example into a file named `example.go`,
and run it. You should see: nothing.

If that is what you see, then you have successfully installed `go-tarantool` and
successfully executed a program that manipulated the contents of a Tarantool
database.

<h2>API reference</h2>

Read the [Tarantool manual](http://tarantool.org/doc.html) to find descriptions
of terms like "connect", "space", "index", and the requests for creating and
manipulating database objects or Lua functions.

The source files for the requests library are:
* [connection.go](https://github.com/tarantool/go-tarantool/blob/master/connection.go)
  for the `Connect()` function plus functions related to connecting, and
* [request.go](https://github.com/tarantool/go-tarantool/blob/master/request.go)
  for data-manipulation functions and Lua invocations.

See comments in those files for syntax details:
```
Ping
closeConnection
Select
Insert
Replace
Delete
Update
Upsert
Call
Call17
Eval
```

The supported requests have parameters and results equivalent to requests in the
Tarantool manual. There are also Typed and Async versions of each data-manipulation
function.

The source file for error-handling tools is
[errors.go](https://github.com/tarantool/go-tarantool/blob/master/errors.go),
which has structure definitions and constants whose names are equivalent to names
of errors that the Tarantool server returns.

## Walking-through example

We can now have a closer look at the `example.go` program and make some observations
about what it does.

```go
package main

import (
     "fmt"
     "github.com/tarantool/go-tarantool"
)

func main() {
   opts := tarantool.Opts{User: "guest"}
   conn, err := tarantool.Connect("127.0.0.1:3301", opts)
   // conn, err := tarantool.Connect("/path/to/tarantool.socket", opts)
   if err != nil {
       fmt.Println("Connection refused:", err)
   }
   resp, err := conn.Insert(999, []interface{}{99999, "BB"})
   if err != nil {
     fmt.Println("Error", err)
     fmt.Println("Code", resp.Code)
   }
}
```

**Observation 1:** the line "`github.com/tarantool/go-tarantool`" in the
`import(...)` section brings in all Tarantool-related functions and structures.

**Observation 2:** the line beginning with "`Opts :=`" sets up the options for
`Connect()`. In this example, there is only one thing in the structure, a user
name. The structure can also contain:

* `Pass` (password),
* `Timeout` (maximum number of milliseconds to wait before giving up),
* `Reconnect` (number of seconds to wait before retrying if a connection fails),
* `MaxReconnect` (maximum number of times to retry).

**Observation 3:** the line containing "`tarantool.Connect`" is essential for
beginning any session. There are two parameters:

* a string with `host:port` format, and
* the option structure that was set up earlier.

**Observation 4:** the `err` structure will be `nil` if there is no error,
otherwise it will have a description which can be retrieved with `err.Error()`.

**Observation 5:** the `Insert` request, like almost all requests, is preceded by
"`conn.`" which is the name of the object that was returned by `Connect()`.
There are two parameters:

* a space number (it could just as easily have been a space name), and
* a tuple.

## Help

To contact `go-tarantool` developers on any problems, create an issue at
[tarantool/go-tarantool](http://github.com/tarantool/go-tarantool/issues).

The developers of the [Tarantool server](http://github.com/tarantool/tarantool)
will also be happy to provide advice or receive feedback.

## Tests

You need to [install Tarantool](https://www.tarantool.io/en/download/) to run tests.
See [Installation](#installation) section for requirements.

To install test dependencies (like [tarantool/queue](https://github.com/tarantool/queue) module), run
```bash
make deps
```

To run tests for the main package and each subpackage, call
```bash
make test
```
Tests set up all required `tarantool` processes before run and clean up after.

If you want to run a specific package tests, go to a package folder
```bash
cd multi
```
and call
```bash
go clean -testcache && go test -v
```
Use the same for main `tarantool` package and `queue` and `uuid` subpackages.
`uuid` tests require
[Tarantool 2.4.1 or newer](https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/commit/d68fc29246714eee505bc9bbcd84a02de17972c5).

## Alternative connectors

There are two more connectors from the open-source community available:
* [viciious/go-tarantool](https://github.com/viciious/go-tarantool),
* [FZambia/tarantool](https://github.com/FZambia/tarantool).
